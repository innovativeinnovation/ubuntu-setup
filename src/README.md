# Ubuntu setup

Ubuntu is one of the most easy to use Linux distribution and it's preferred
by most of the beginner Linux users. It obviously doesn't mean that Linux
experts do not use Ubuntu. There are tons of official documentation along
with numerous how-to tutorials available on a number of websites, blogs and
support forums.

environment with Ubuntu. Whether you are an experienced programmer or
not, this guide is intended for everyone to use as a reference for
establishing your environment, installing a languages/libraries or some tools.

quality documentation for teams.
